# challenge-two

## Description

This challenge focused on building a portfolio web application without being provided any start code to which I can build upon as the course progresses. 

- What was your motivation?
I wanted to create an interactive portfolio for any future employers or clients to showcase what I have learned over the course of this class.

- What did you learn?
I found that through trial, error and good research skills I was able to comprehend how certain commands are tied to one another and can change the output of the result. I learned that it is very important to only change one item at a time in order to solve problems as they arise instead of creating new ones.
